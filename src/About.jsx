                    I&#39;m an enthusiastic programmer, gamer, and music lover. I&#39;m perpetually online, working on projects, gaming or exploring more fun things to be a nerd about. I&#39;ve always been fascinated by technology.

                    A big part of my life right now revolves around tabletop RPGs. I&#39;m currently running two different D&D campaigns. Each one has its own storylines, monsters and challenges. I like stories about fantastical and epic adventures, which is what motivates me to design tools and story elements that improve the experience for me and my friends.

                    <strong>Some things I&#39;m into:</strong><br />
                    &bull; Everything about Lord of the Rings. The new LotR-adjacent stuff they&#39;re shelling out for moneygrabs is garbage.<br />
                    &bull; Experimenting with music production software, even though I&#39;m not that musically gifted.<br />
                    &bull; Gaming across a variety of genres. I like tabletop, strategy, story-based and platformer games the most.<br />
